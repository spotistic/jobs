Web-app Engineering (Internship)
====

We are **Spotistic**, a Berlin-based startup, looking for a **software engineer** intern for 6+ months starting ASAP. Join us in **Europe's startup melting pot**!


### Berlin rather feels like a startup itself

In the heart of Berlin's startup ecosystem, next to **SoundCloud**, **Gidsy** and **6Wunderkinder**, we are building the next generation **local social intelligence** solution.

Interested in joining a **StartupBootcamp** accelerated company in the midst of fundraising and reaching product/market fit? You will be served with great challenges to grow beyond yourself and be considered a valuable and necessary team member!


### More about Spotistic

We are re-inventing local marketing as we provide retailers with **local data** (from Foursquare, Facebook, and other platforms), **news**, and **insights** on the spot.

We are happy to solve tough technical problems: aggregating various data feeds, semantical analysis, and data-mining.

Weâ€™ve created a fun, casual work environment that lets you work to your maximum potential. We work together, inspiring and mentoring each other to build a great product, having fun along the way and celebrating our successes.


### The Technology Stack

###### Backend

* **MongoDB** (Map/Reduce)

* **iOS/Android** SDK
* **Socket.io**


### Role & Responsibilities

You will be part of the agile development team and work on the web application for our customers.

We could ask what language you program in or how many years of experience you have, but that's just not how we roll. **Are you smart? Do you work your ass off? Can you learn new languages and concepts without hesitation?**

**Your intelligence, ingenuity, and problem-solving skills are more important than your experience** with the particular tech stack that we are using, but you should be happy to learn new technologies and start using them quickly.

**You should be fun to hang with for hours** -- because we'll be spending a hell of a lot of time together.

Your **mission** will mainly consist in:

* Contributing to the development of the global **web-app**
* Interacting with the backend **API** and contribute to its development
* Taking part in development discussions/choices

You will be free to choose your tools (dev environment, etc.).

### Bonus points

* HTML5/CSS
* Javascript (MV* frameworks)
